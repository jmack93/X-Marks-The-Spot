# How To Play
Ahoy! The rules are simple, simply pick a beach to search by clicking on an "X" and a pop up will alert you as to if you picked the correct location of the treasure.
If you happen to pick the wrong spot, the treasure will remain in the same location until you find it! Once you find the treasure, you can play again, and the location will change. Good luck!
